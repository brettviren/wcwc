#+title: WCWC - Wire-Cell Workstation Cluster
#+export_file_name: index

The WCWC is a computer conglomeration that the Wire-Cell team developed to reduce effort and lower barriers to develop Wire-Cell software.  It defines a simple developer workflow while also supporting novel ways to do work.  It highly leverages Spack to provide software.

The requirements for a user workstation to participate in WCWC are few:

- Run a supported OS (currently Debian 12 / bookworm).
- Share a LAN with the WCWC server.

Entry points:

- The [[file:docs/wcwc-user.org][WCWC user]] document for things to do on your WCWC user workstation.
  
- The [[file:docs/wcwc-system.org][WCWC system]] documents for how to admin the WCWC.

- The [[file:scripts/wcwc][wcwc]] command provides a tool to assist both WCWC user and admin roles.
