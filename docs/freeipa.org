#+title: Using FreeIPA

* Motivation

Local accounts exist on current workstations and their IDs are all not unique.
At the same time we want to allow $N_{users}$ to log into $N_{workstations}$ and
creating local accounts does not scale well.  Further, users want to mount their
~$HOME~ from their local workstation to a remote workstation.  NFS will not
correctly handle file permissions given the lack of unique user IDs.  Using
FreeIPA provides for distributed account management and (may?) provide user ID
mapping (if not, we must change local user IDs and file permissions).

The Physics department has a FreeIPA server (Kerberos, LDAP and bells and
whistles) which is already used for SSH gateways and others.  It was used long
ago to provide accounts to summer students on a set of workstations.  
An Ansible  config from that era exists at
#+begin_example
gogs@git.phy.bnl.gov:bv/physics-server-config.git
#+end_example
In principle, it should be a relatively painless adoption.
